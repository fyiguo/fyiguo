# About me

I am a conservation biologist and migration ecologist focusing on solutions-oriented research. Currently, I am a [Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability 🌳](https://www.atkinson.cornell.edu/cornell-atkinson-postdocs-rfp-2025/) and a [Rose Fellow at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology 🦜](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/rose-postdoctoral-fellowship-annual-competition/).

I study the stopover ecology and conservation of migratory birds 🐦 , and I also love to spend time with my two cats 🐈.
