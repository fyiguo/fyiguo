# About me

I am a conservation biologist and migration ecologist focusing on solutions-oriented research. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability and a Rose Fellow at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

I study the stopover ecology and conservation of migratory landbirds in North America. Combining data-intensive radar remote sensing and on-the-ground field surveys, my research focuses on identifying stopover hotspots and key habitats for migratory landbirds during the en-route period, thus completing the full annual cycle conservation of migratory species.
