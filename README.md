# About me

I am a conservation biologist and migration ecologist focusing on solutions-oriented research. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability 🌳 and a Rose Fellow at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology 🦜.

I study the stopover ecology and conservation of migratory birds 🐦 , and I also have two cats 🐈.
